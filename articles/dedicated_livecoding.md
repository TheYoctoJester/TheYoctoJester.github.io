# Dedicated Yocto Livecoding Sessions

*July 27, 2025*

Building on my public [livecoding sessions](/livecoding.md), here's something new: **3-hour dedicated [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) livecoding sessions for your organization**, sponsored by [Mender.io](https://mender.io).

## What you get

Same livecoding approach, but focused on your team. We dive deep into Yocto, debug real issues, build actual things - except this time it's tailored to your specific needs.

Perfect for **engineering societies, educational organizations, universities, and technical communities**. Also available for commercial companies who want their teams to get hands-on with Yocto.

* 3 hours of hands-on, interactive Yocto introduction
* Complete scripts and recordings to replicate everything afterwards
* Live coding driven by YOUR questions and challenges
* No death by PowerPoint - just real work in real-time

## What can we cover?

These sessions are the "Yocto Tour de Force" - a comprehensive hands-on journey through:

* Setting up Yocto from scratch for your target hardware
* Creating custom recipes and layers
* Building your own distribution
* Kernel configuration and patching
* Hardware integration (I2C, SPI, you name it)
* Integrating [Mender](https://mender.io) for OTA updates
* Using [kas](https://github.com/siemens/kas) for reproducible builds
* Debugging that weird build error that's been haunting you

Or honestly? **Whatever Yocto challenge is keeping you up at night.**

While I have a preferred flow of topics that builds understanding progressively, the real magic happens when you interrupt with questions. That's when we dive into what actually matters to you and your project.

## Why am I doing this?

Simple: The public sessions have shown me how much faster people learn by watching real work happen in real-time. No slides, no rehearsed demos - just real development with real problems and real solutions.

And thanks to Mender.io's sponsorship, we can make this accessible to teams who need a hands-on introduction without the overhead of traditional multi-day courses.

## Let's be clear

* **This IS**: A hands-on introduction with complete materials to replicate
* **This IS NOT**: A replacement for comprehensive multi-day training courses
* **This IS**: Interactive learning driven by your questions
* **This IS NOT**: Me doing your development work for you

## How does it work?

1. We schedule a 3-hour block that works for your team
2. You tell me what you want to focus on (or trust my flow)
3. I show up and we dive in together
4. Your team interrupts with questions - that's where the real learning happens
5. You get all scripts and recordings to replicate everything later

### Virtual or On-Site?

Default is virtual, but hey - I'm based in Bavaria. If you're in southern Germany or adjacent regions, we can coordinate an on-site session. Sometimes nothing beats being in the same room.

### The deal

**Free of charge** if [Mender.io](https://mender.io)/[Northern.tech](https://northern.tech) and I can mention that we're doing a session at your organization. Great PR for everyone.

Want it completely private? Fine - let's talk compensation.

## Interested?

[Reach out to me directly](/contact.md) or through [Mender.io](https://mender.io) to discuss scheduling and topics. Let's get your team unstuck and moving forward with Yocto!

*Remember: The best way to learn Yocto is by doing Yocto. Let's do it together.*
