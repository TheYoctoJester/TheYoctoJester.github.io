### Want something special?

Get in touch!

I do a lot of stuff, like
* Live coding (obviously)
* Moderation
* Articles
* Keynotes (I love Keynotes!)
* Speaking at meetups/conferences
* Showcasing / general PR work

If you are interested, I'm sure we can find a way to work together. If it is something that provides value to the public and community, I will also give substancial discounts. Please note however that I will only work on topics that I like. As I am not doing this for a living, this is the freedom I take.

### Attention!

If you hire me, be aware that I do **NOT** offer a classic trainer/speaker experience. You asked a Jester after all, right?

For a standard format training, I will happily recommend somebody I see fit, though.
