# Live Coding Session #0x10 (16) - Surprise Topic!

When: Tuesday October 20th, 2020 - 5:00 PM Europe/Berlin

Topic: To celebrate the 0x10th live coding session, I am preparing a particularly crazy/entertaining topic. We are building a distribution to run on Windows, namely the WSLv2 Subsystem for Linux.

## Notes from session

- This is essentially a container running on a kernel/runtime combination supplied by Microsoft
- There are some inconsistencies concerning file ownership/permissions, depending on where the actual editor is running (Windows host / Linux subsystem)
