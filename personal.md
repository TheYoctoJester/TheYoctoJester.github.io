# Personal Jesting!

*July 27, 2025*

## About me

I'm a Developer Enablement Expert at [Mender.io](https://mender.io)/Northern.tech, and serve as both Ambassador and Community Manager for the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/). My focus areas are Yocto Project, embedded Linux, OTA updates, Zephyr RTOS, and building developer communities.

## Want something special?

I still take on personal speaking, training, and consulting work - but only when:
* There's no conflict of interest with my Mender.io work
* I have the bandwidth and time
* I feel like doing it (this is the freedom I take!)

I do various activities, including:
* Conference speaking and keynotes (I love keynotes!)
* Community workshops and training sessions
* Technical writing and articles
* Live coding and demonstrations
* Event moderation
* Developer community building

If it provides value to the public and community, I'm happy to discuss flexible arrangements. My expertise covers Yocto Project, embedded Linux, OTA updates, and anything that helps developers build better embedded systems.

## Fair warning!

If you work with me, be aware that I do **NOT** offer a classic trainer/speaker experience. You're getting a Jester after all, right? 

My approach is hands-on, interactive, and real-world focused. Think live debugging, honest discussions about what actually works (and what doesn't), and learning through doing.

For standard format training, I'll happily recommend someone better suited for that style.
