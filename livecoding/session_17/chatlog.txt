[0:12:28] <mgFray> HeyGuys mgfrayTux
[0:15:09] <TheYoctoJester> howdy @mgFray
[0:15:27] <Nepster375> First time I'm live :)
[0:16:01] <mgFray> unfortunately it's only 10am here, a bit early for a proper drink.. :)
[0:21:39] <mgFray> "grahpic"(sic) was spelled wrong..
[0:24:57] <gvkalra> what if I want to install all packages in a recipe? Do i still need to explicitly write each package name in IMAGE_INSTAL?
[0:26:01] <gvkalra> Send them over. haha! üòÑ
[0:26:09] <mgFray> mgfrayNoBugs
[0:26:13] <mgFray> best one I got.. ;)
[0:27:43] <mgFray> LuvGift <--- I might have chocolates..
[0:31:18] <mgFray> FYI, much of the time overrides can be done in a distribution configuration file. This allows you to modify many packages defaults in one place w/o having to write bbappends. PACKAGECONFIGS_pn-<recipe> = "Your distro configs here"
[0:32:07] <mgFray> leading space?
[0:32:58] <mgFray> mgfrayNoBugs
[0:33:28] <mgFray> it's from a Twitch charity thing from a few years ago
[0:33:31] <Nepster375> I'm confused.. Why did you drink water instead of beer?
[0:33:35] <mgFray> winter time here, so I ue a snowflake.. :)
[0:33:42] <mgFray> HSCheers here have a beer
[0:35:01] <mgFray> Ahh ha, I made the same mistake above.. ya no 'S'
[0:35:24] <mgFray> (everyone can haave a beer.. HS Cheers remove the space)
[0:36:09] <gvkalra> beer time!
[0:36:27] <mgFray> HSCheers
[0:39:23] <Nepster375> Why do we have to prepend "libanswer" with "pn-"?
[0:40:33] <mgFray> there is a special override for recipes. The format of the override is 'pn-<recipe>'. So you can override any variable in a recipe using this.. PACKAGECONFIG is this example, but it could be other things
[0:40:39] <gvkalra> If there is a policy in .bb (e.g. use boost), and also in .conf (e.g., dont use boost)... Both with = assignment.... Which will be the priority?
[0:41:47] <mgFray> The bitbake manual has some explanation of what an override is in the variables section. This might be helpful (or might not be -- some of the variable assignment stuff is confusing)
[0:42:01] <mgFray> Yes, last assignment is used
[0:42:13] <Nepster375> To answer your question: I just joined the german Discord server and got the announcement there (and in the IRC). As I'm quite new, I wasn't involved in yocto before..
[0:42:30] <mgFray> teh distro file is loaded early, the recipe file is loaded late.. so "=" in the recipe would be 'last'.. but ?= says 'if not set, use this'
[0:43:05] <gvkalra> thanks @mgfray ~
[0:45:29] <mgFray> It's about variable scope. There is a global variable scope, and a recipe scope (that inherits from the global scope). So a recipeA variable scope, can't affect recipeB variable scope.
[0:47:22] <mgFray> These helpers are incredibly powerful
[0:48:36] <gvkalra> poweroff
[0:48:40] <mgFray> still in QEMU
[0:49:28] <mgFray> according to twitch you are 20 seconds into my future.. ;)
[0:49:42] <cobequidd> ctrl-a x, no need to be polite to qemu ;)
[0:50:25] <gvkalra> Mr. cobequidd ... Be polite ü§£
[0:51:42] <mgFray> ctrl-a x is equivalent to pigeon32Cool pigeon32Gun mgfrayTux

[0:52:22] <Nepster375> isn't it EXTRA_OEMAKE without the "C"?
[0:53:00] <gvkalra> Thanks. I am from S. Korea. It's 1.30am here. Usually I watch your videos later. üòÑ
[0:53:19] <Nepster375> K, thanks :)
[0:53:20] <mgFray> wow, dedication (or insomnia).. thanks for joining!
[0:55:26] <gvkalra> insomnia üòú
[0:56:29] <mgFray> HSCheers
[0:57:01] <gvkalra> üí∏
[0:57:15] <mgFray> Ohhh.. nice.. I'm working on multiconfig right now..
[0:57:22] <mgFray> they definitely need a session
[0:58:03] <mgFray> System is the top level, then multiple implementations are multiconfig..
[0:58:17] <mgFray> this would allow the System to construct the image, including things 'above' linux, like firmware, u-boot, etc
[0:58:43] <mgFray> might have been bruce.. :)
[0:59:29] <gvkalra> Ilibanswer answers the mysteries of Yocto
[1:01:11] <mgFray> oe-pkgdata-util is somewhat new right? Dunfell or Gatesgarth?
[1:02:10] <mgFray> someone on IRC said it's much older..
[1:02:32] <mgFray> ahh it must be browser that I'm thinking of that is new..
[1:03:25] <gvkalra> üçª Thank You~
[1:03:38] <mgFray> thanks for the stream! Have a good day!
