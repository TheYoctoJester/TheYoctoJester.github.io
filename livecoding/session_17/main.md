# Live Coding Session 17 - Recipes Reloaded

When: Tuesday November 24th, 2020 - 5:00 PM Europe/Berlin

Topic: Recipes are an integral part of the whole Yocto/OpenEmbedded technology, and this time we'll have a lock at some facilities they bring, like PACKAGECONFIGs and triggering on MACHINEs or DISTRO_FEATURES. This leads up to building a debug-enabled DISTRO for custom images.
