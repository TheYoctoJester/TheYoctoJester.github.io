# Its not just about Embedded! The Yocto Project - Linux Foundation Mentorship Sessions

When: Wednesday September 15th, 2021 - 3:30 PM Europe/Berlin

## Abstract

“Embedded Linux people build custom Linux systems.” Thats how things are, right? And yeah, they do that a real lot for sure. But why invest all that effort? Aren’t there enough Linux systems out in the wild already?

This session will show you the Yocto Project, one of the most widely used platforms for creating a custom Linux system. To give you a hands-down impression of what this means in real life, Josef will build and boot for RISC-V from source while providing a live show and tell about the underlying technology and its ins and outs – and why you might want your own custom Linux soon.

The session will begin with an overview by Josef Holzmayr and Nicolas Dechesne (45 minutes) and followed by Q&A – an opportunity to both ask Josef and Nicolas questions and for group discussion (45 minutes).
